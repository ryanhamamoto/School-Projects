sieve.c
	Written by Darrell Long, this program creates a bit vector indicating which
	numbers in the sequence are primes and which are not.
sieve.h
	The header file that contains the functions in which sieve.c defines.
bv.c
	A function library called by sieve.c, provides functionality for implementing
	the sieve function. Functions have the ability to set individual bits to 1 or 0,
	free memory, and return the length and value of the bit vector or specific values
	within the bit vector.
bv.h
	the header file that contains the functions in which bv.c defines.
parfait.c
	contains main(), calls both sieve and bv in order to automatically generate
	a list ranging form 2 to 100000 indicating which numbers are prime, composite,
	and perfect. It also gives the prime factorization of composite numbers and proper
	divisors of perfect numbers.
Makefile
	create the executable "parfait" by typing "make" into the console. parfait can then
	be run by typing "./parfait", automatically generating the list that ends at 100000.
	Call "make clean" to delete the files created by "make".
