The list of proscribed words must be provided as badspeak.txt.
The replacementmapping must be provided as newspeak.txt.

./banhammer has the following options (can be inputed in any order or combination):

./banhammer -s will suppress the letter from the censor, and instead print the statistics that were
computed.
./banhammer -h size specifies that the hash table will have size entries (the default will be 10000).
./banhammer -f size specifies that the Bloom filter will have size entries (the default will be 220).
./banhammer -m will use the move-to-front rule.
./banhammer -b will not use the move-to-front rule.


aes.h aes.c
	contains functionality to implement hash functions
bf.c bf.h
	a library of bloom filter functions that are used to implement the two initial bloom filters
	filtering out badspeak
ll.c ll.h
	a library of linked list functions that are used to implement the hash table and bloom filters
hash.c hash.h
	a library of hash table functions that are used to implement the newspeak hashtable
words.l
	flex is called on this function to create lex.yy.c which is then compiled with the rest of the
	functions (see makefile) and is used to tokenize user input into strings that can be filtered
	and hashed.
banhammer.c
	contains main(), used to implement -s (shows statistics of operations), -h (to change the hash
	table size) -f (to change the bloom filter size) -m (which will implement the move to front rule)
	and -b (which will not implement the move to front rule). Sends user input through two bloom filters
	to filter out badspeak and one hash table to correlate newspeak with words that were deemed
	inappropriate.
Makefile
	supports make, make all (generate executables), make clean (delete executables and object files).
